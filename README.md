# Research about steganographic methods of data concealing into vector graphic images

    This project was created for a bachelor graduation work and is dedicated to an implementation of Kinzeryaviy's methods of data concealing in vector images.

The key points of the implemantation:
- SVG images
- Bezier curves
- De Casteljau algorithm
- JavaScript

Problems:
- parser for handling SVG-images is not ideal
- images should be specially chosen (or created on your own)

Additional:
- examples of recommended images-containers can be found in ./images folder
- after encoding stegokeys should be saved to a suggested directory
- decoding requires stegokeys saved while encoding

## NOTE
    Experiments page does not have any visual representation, all obtained data is shown in the console. For any additional information you can get acquainted with my publications [here](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57208665914).
